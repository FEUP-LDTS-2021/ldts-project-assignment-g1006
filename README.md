## LDTS_<10><1006> - Space Invaders


In this text based game you'll fight the Earth invaders with your own spaceship! The objective is to take down every single alien ship without being hit once. If your ship is the last one standing you won the game. Good luck, our future is in your hands.

### Implemented Features

- **Movement** - Single direction movement. Every spaceship moves horizontally.

- **Aliens** - Represented by character 'A'. They switch direction when they are about to leave the arena. SCREENSHOT OF THE ALIENS
- **Ammo** - The player can shoot multiple bullets. If an alien is hit, it will die and dissapear from the screen.

### Planned Features

- **Aliens** - They exist in many shapes and forms. Some will be able to shoot back at the player (only the ones that dont have any others bellow them). They can have armor aswell.
MOCK OF FUTURE ALIENS

- **Menu** - We will design a Menu for the game, which will be able to redirect the player to the leaderboard or the game.
MOCK OF FUTURE MENU

- **Leaderboard** - Contains the best players' names, and the time that needed to defeat the Aliens.
MOCK OF THE FUTURE LEADERBOARD

- **Shields** - They will be deployed between the Player and the Aliens. They can suport a limited ammount of Ammo, so they will eventually break.
MOCK OF FUTURE SHIELDS

- **Ammo** - The ammo that the player can shoot will be limited. In this way, it can only shoot one or a few bulltets at a time..
