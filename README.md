## LDTS_<10><1006> - Space Invaders


In this text based game you'll fight the Earth invaders with your own spaceship. The objective will be to take down every single alien ship without being hit once. If your ship is the last one standing you won the game. Good luck, our future is in your hands.

### Features List

- Single direction movement. Every spaceship will only move horizontally.
- Diffent types of alien spaceships. Some will be able to shoot back or reflect your shots.
- Ammo cooldown. You can only have one ammo running in the screen.
